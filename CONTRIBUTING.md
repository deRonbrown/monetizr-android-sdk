# Contributing
Contributions of all types are welcome.
We use GitHub as our bug and feature tracker both for code and for other aspects of the library (documentation, the wiki, etc.).


## Asking Questions
The best way to ask general questions is to send an email to mj@themonetizr.com.


## Filing issues
When in doubt, file an issue. We'd rather close a few duplicate issues than let a problem go unnoticed.
Similarly if you support a particular feature request, feel free to let us know by commenting on the issue.

To file a new issue - add it in issues, the more information you can provide, the more likely we are to be able help.


## Contributing code
Pull requests are welcome for all parts of the codebase.
You can find instructions on building the project in [README.md][1] and in integration documentation [Docs][2].

## Labels
Labels on issues are managed by contributors, you don't have to worry about them. Here's a list of what they mean:

 * **bug**: feature that should work, but doesn't
 * **enhancement**: minor tweak/addition to existing behavior
 * **feature**: new behavior, bigger than enhancement, it gives more bang
 * **question**: no need to modify or to fix the issue, usually a usage problem
 * **reproducible**: has enough information to very easily reproduce, mostly in form of a small project in a GitHub repo
 * **repro-needed**: we need some code to be able to reproduce and debug locally, otherwise there's not much we can do
 * **duplicate**: there's another issue which already covers/tracks this
 * **wontfix**: working as intended, or won't be fixed due to compatibility or other reasons
 * **invalid**: there isn't enough information to make a verdict
 * **non-library**: issue is not in the core library code, but rather in documentation, samples, build process, releases

*bug + enhancement: feature that doesn't work, but it's an edge case that either has a workaround or doesn't affect many users*
